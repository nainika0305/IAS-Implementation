# IAS-Implementation

This assignment focuses on the design and implementation of an IAS processor using the IAS instruction set architecture. I made a program to find the roots of a quadratic equation. I implemented multiple components, including an assembler, custom instructions, and the processor itself. This assignment was done as a part of my Computer Architecture Course in semester 2.
